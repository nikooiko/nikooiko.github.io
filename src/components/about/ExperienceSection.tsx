              In 2021, I became Centaur's Director Of Engineering in charge of
              leading the Centaur's R&D department. I lead the Product

              knowledge, I started upgrading our technology to use more modern
              tools and versions and moved our cluster from self-managed to
              provider-managed.

              In 2018, I became a senior software engineer and leader of
              Centaurâ€™s embedded team, and in parallel, I was supporting the web
              team by taking some load off of their hands when a critical
              deadline approached. This allowed me to rapidly create truly
              end-to-end solutions, ranging from the embedded device to the
              client application.

              I was also responsible for managing the backlog, coordinating the
              team, and interviewing/training new team members.

              Occasionally, on the side, I supported the field engineers, and
              sometimes I directly communicated with the clients to resolve
              their issues.

              In 2016 I joined the web app team, as a full-stack developer, to
              work with Centaurâ€™s cloud services. My responsibilities included
              both back-end and front-end development, but I focused more on the
              back-end working with its architecture and migrating from monolith
              to microservices to build a more scalable cloud infrastructure.
